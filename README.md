# Emojify (Create your own emoji with Deep Learning) 

A  project for the course Statistical Software 4. The project revolves around creating a machine learning model that can recognise the emotions of subjects based on a provided video recording. During the project development, we utilised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a program that can detect faces and their corresponding emotions from video recordings and created a GUI that displays an emoji that corresponds to the detected emotion.
